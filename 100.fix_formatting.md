globally install "standard" package:


```
npm install -g standard
```

Then run the following to fix linting issues:

```
standard --fix
```


Hover it's better to have this in the package.json file:

```

  "scripts": {
    ...
    "lint": "standard --verbose",
    "lint:fix": "standard --verbose --fix"
    ...
  },
  ...
    "devDependencies": {
    ...
    "standard": "^16.0.3",
    ...
  },
```

So that you can run:

```
$ npm run lint:fix        

$ npm run lint            
```

This approach is better because you don't need to install `standard` globally, and everyone will be using the same version of the standard package.
